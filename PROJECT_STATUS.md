# Incus Composer - Project Status

## Phase 1: Schema Design - ✅ COMPLETED

### Objective
Design the incus-compose.yaml schema for managing Incus system containers and virtual machines.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Project Infrastructure
- ✅ Initialized pixi-based Rust project (alternative to rustup)
- ✅ Set up Cargo project structure
- ✅ Added core dependencies:
  - reqwest (v0.12) - HTTP client for Incus REST API
  - serde (v1.0) - Serialization framework
  - serde_yaml (v0.9) - YAML support
  - tokio (v1) - Async runtime
- ✅ Configured pixi tasks (build, test, run, fmt, clippy)
- ✅ Set up .gitignore for Rust and pixi artifacts

#### 2. Schema Design
- ✅ Designed comprehensive schema structure
- ✅ Implemented Rust types with serde support:
  - `IncusCompose` - Root configuration
  - `Container` - Instance definitions (containers and VMs)
  - `Network` - Network configurations
  - `StoragePool` - Storage pool definitions
  - `Profile` - Reusable configuration profiles
  - `Device` - Hardware device configurations
  - `CloudInit` - Cloud-init integration
  - Resource limits (CPU, Memory)
  - Volume mounts
  - Environment variables
  - Dependency management

#### 3. Documentation
- ✅ SCHEMA.md - Complete schema documentation
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md - Developer guide for pixi usage
- ✅ README.md - Project overview and quick start
- ✅ examples/incus-compose.yaml - Comprehensive example
- ✅ examples/simple.yaml - Minimal example

#### 4. Validation
- ✅ Schema validator in main.rs
- ✅ Unit tests for serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Example YAML files validated successfully
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code review completed (no issues)
- ✅ Security scan completed (no vulnerabilities)

### Key Features of the Schema

The incus-compose.yaml schema includes:

1. **Instance Management**
   - Support for both containers and virtual machines
   - Base image configuration
   - Resource limits (CPU, memory)
   - Autostart and boot priority
   - Instance dependencies

2. **Networking**
   - Multiple network types (bridge, macvlan, OVN, etc.)
   - Network interface configuration
   - IPv4/IPv6 support
   - NAT configuration

3. **Storage**
   - Multiple storage pool drivers (dir, btrfs, lvm, zfs, ceph)
   - Volume mounting
   - Read-only volumes
   - Pool-specific configuration

4. **Devices**
   - Disk devices
   - Network interfaces (NIC)
   - Port proxies
   - GPU passthrough
   - USB device passthrough

5. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables
   - Cloud-init integration
   - Profile system for reusable configs
   - Instance-specific configuration options

### Schema Philosophy

Unlike docker-compose which focuses on application containers, incus-composer is designed for:
- **System Infrastructure**: Full system containers and VMs
- **Hardware Integration**: Direct hardware device passthrough
- **Network Flexibility**: Complex network topologies
- **Storage Management**: Multiple storage backends
- **Configuration Reuse**: Profile-based configuration

### Quality Metrics

- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ All tests pass (2/2)
- ✅ No compiler warnings in release mode
- ✅ Example configurations validate successfully
- ✅ Code review: No issues
- ✅ Security scan: No vulnerabilities
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Next Steps (Future Phases)

Phase 2 will include:
1. Implement Incus REST API client using reqwest
2. Create CLI interface with clap
3. Implement container/VM lifecycle operations
4. Network management operations
5. Storage pool management operations
6. Profile management
7. Dependency resolution and startup ordering

### Conclusion

Phase 1 (Schema Design) is **complete and ready for review**. The schema provides a solid foundation for managing Incus infrastructure in a declarative way, similar to docker-compose but tailored for system containers and virtual machines.
