Inspired by docker-compose and distinct as linux-containers are for applications and incus-containers are for machines.

== Overview

`incus-composer` is a tool for managing https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/[Incus] system containers and virtual machines using a declarative YAML configuration file, similar to how docker-compose manages application containers.

While docker-compose is focused on application deployment, incus-composer is designed for system-level infrastructure management, including:

* Full system containers
* Virtual machines
* Network infrastructure
* Storage pools
* Hardware device passthrough
* Cloud-init integration

== Schema

The `incus-compose.yaml` schema is inspired by docker-compose but adapted for system containers and VMs.
See <<schema.adoc#,Schema Documentation>> for complete documentation.

=== Example Configuration

include::includes/schema-examples.adoc[tags=container-with-networking]

See `examples/incus-compose.yaml` for a comprehensive example.

== Development

This project uses https://pixi.sh/[pixi] for dependency management instead of rustup.

=== Building Documentation

The project documentation is built using pixi tasks:

[source,bash]
----
# Build all documentation formats
pixi run docs

# Clean and build documentation
pixi run docs-clean

# Build only HTML documentation
pixi run docs-html
----

== Incus API

This tool communicates with Incus via its REST API.
See the https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/rest-api/[Incus REST API documentation] for details.
